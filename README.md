# Automated Hiring Bias Analysis Tool

## Overview
The **Automated Hiring Bias Analysis Tool** helps detect gender and racial biases in hiring processes. It analyzes recruitment data, provides an NLP-based bias report, and visualizes selection rates. Users can upload data, view insights, and download the analysis report, helping organizations ensure fair and unbiased hiring practices.

## Requirements
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `streamlit`

To install the required libraries, run:

```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn streamlit
```

# How to Run

1. Clone or download the repository.
2. Navigate to the project directory in your terminal.
3. Run the app with the following command:

    ```bash
    streamlit run app.py
    ```

4. The app will open in your default browser.

# Data Format

The input data should be in CSV format with the following columns:

- `gender`: Candidate's gender (e.g., 'male', 'female')
- `race`: Candidate's race (e.g., 'white', 'black')
- `received_callback`: Binary outcome (1 = yes, 0 = no)
- Job-related factors: `job_req_education`, `job_req_min_experience`, `job_req_computer`, `college_degree`, `years_experience`, `computer_skills`, `resume_quality`

**Example:**

```csv
gender,race,received_callback,job_req_education,job_req_min_experience,job_req_computer,college_degree,years_experience,computer_skills,resume_quality
male,white,1,high,5,advanced,yes,3,yes,high
female,black,0,medium,3,intermediate,no,1,yes,medium
```

# Features

- **Bias Detection**: Identifies gender and racial biases in the hiring process based on callback rates.
- **NLP Explanation**: Provides a detailed explanation of the bias detected in the hiring process.
- **Visualizations**: Displays graphs for selection rates by gender and race, and a heatmap showing correlations between job factors and callback rate.
- **Data Upload/Manual Entry**: Users can upload CSV files or enter data manually in the app.
- **Downloadable Report**: Users can download the analysis report as a text file.

# How It Works

1. **Data Upload**: Upload a CSV file or enter data manually in the app.
2. **Data Processing**: The tool processes the data and calculates selection rates, bias ratios, and job-related factors.
3. **Bias Report**: The app generates an automated NLP-based bias analysis report, highlighting gender and racial bias, along with the impact of job qualifications on hiring decisions.
4. **Visualizations**: The app also displays visualizations to aid in understanding the data and bias.
5. **Downloadable Report**: After analyzing the data, users can download the detailed bias report in a text file format.
